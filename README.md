# Lending Club Database Analysis and Machine Learning Alghoritms

## This project took the following steps:
  - **Starter Code** (importing libraries, setting up the description and main dataframes and seeing whether there are missing values)
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis** (understanding the importance of each column and their correlations before transforming the data)
  - **Data Pre Processing** (transforming the data - filling in, removing, creating dummy variables and transforming the format of the data to prepare for the model)
  - **Train/Test Split** (after having the data ready, we can split the data into training and testing data and normalize it with a MinMaxScaler)
  - **Creating the model** (a model with 4 layers, implemented dropout of 20% and early stopping, using the adam optimizer)
  - **Evaluating the model and testing with a new random client** (checking for overfitting, and evaluating the model with a classification report and a confusion matrix)
